// TileProcessor — real tile splitting + overlap-blended reassembly.
// This is the mechanical piece of "Tile Processing" that was previously
// only described in comments. It is inference-agnostic: you hand it a
// `runInference(tileImageData) => Promise<upscaledTileImageData>` callback,
// and it handles splitting the source frame, calling that callback per
// tile, and reassembling the result with linear-ramp blending across
// overlaps so tile seams don't show up as visible edges.
//
// Correctness of the split/reassemble math is verified directly (Node,
// no browser/network needed) in TileProcessor.test.mjs — a solid-color
// input run through an identity "inference" must come back solid-color
// with no seam artifacts. Real neural-network correctness (does the
// actual model produce good upscaled pixels) still requires a real model
// and cannot be tested without network access to fetch one.
